# TODO

Dean, here’s the short list to keep us moving without drift:

- Tighten the investment thesis with one concrete case study that walks from forecast to gap to bet.
- Draft a repeatable research memo template so every investigation produces comparable, citable outputs.
- Map the content architecture for `docs/` to avoid overlap as we add strategy, ops, and playbooks.
- Define a simple KPI dashboard (quality, velocity, impact) for tracking how our bets nudge the timeline.
- Outline an engagement plan for recruiting external contributors who align with the happy path.

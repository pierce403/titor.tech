# Projects

A living index of the things we’re building (or monitoring) to widen the “happy path” for humans + machines.

## Active / tracked

- [NWEB](nweb.md) — Networked web primitives.
- [LNDY](lndy.md) — Lindy-adjacent systems and design patterns.
- [W3RK](w3rk.md) — Work, tooling, and operational leverage.
- [Bastet](bastet.md) — Security + resilience.
- [Storm Dance](storm-dance.md) — Forecasts and scenario work.

If you’re looking for something specific and it’s missing, that’s a gap we should fill.

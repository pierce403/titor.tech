# Projects

Titor Technologies develops and maintains several innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology and contribute to building a better future. Each project represents our commitment to advancing decentralized technologies, AI systems, and tools that empower human potential:

## Our Projects

- **[storm.dance](storm-dance.md)** - Decentralized note-taking application using IPFS and XMTP
- **[w3rk.net](w3rk.md)** - Web3 jobs platform with UBI/UEI payment system
- **[lndy.org](lndy.md)** - Social lending platform powered by Ethereum
- **[nweb.io](nweb.md)** - Web-based Nmap scan collection and search platform
- **[bastet.ai](bastet.md)** - Experimental infosec DAO and autonomous AI agent platform

## Strategic Alignment with Titor Mission

These projects directly support Titor Technologies' mission to shape humanity's future through strategic investments and technological innovation:

**Decentralized Infrastructure**: storm.dance and w3rk.net demonstrate post-corporate organizational models that reduce dependence on centralized platforms, aligning with our vision of autonomous, resilient systems.

**Future of Work**: w3rk.net specifically addresses the transition from traditional employment to decentralized task coordination, with UBI-ready features that prepare for post-scarcity economics.

**Autonomous Agents**: bastet.ai represents our research into beneficial AI that can manage communities and resources autonomously, a critical component of our long-term vision for AI-assisted human coordination.

**Security & Intelligence**: nweb.io provides essential cybersecurity capabilities needed to protect the infrastructure supporting these emerging technologies.

**Community Building**: Each platform emphasizes community formation and protection, recognizing that technological advancement must be coupled with strong social coordination mechanisms.

Together, these projects form an integrated ecosystem that demonstrates how technology can be deployed to enhance human agency while building more resilient, cooperative systems for the future.

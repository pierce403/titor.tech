# lndy.org

A social lending platform powered by Ethereum that enables peer-to-peer lending with smart contract automation. LNDY (a proof-of-concept for social lending protocol) allows users to create, fund, and manage loans in a decentralized manner, removing traditional financial intermediaries while maintaining security through blockchain technology.

## Key Features

- **Peer-to-Peer Lending**: Direct lending between individuals
- **Smart Contract Automation**: Ethereum-based loan management
- **Social Trust Networks**: Lending based on personal relationships
- **Decentralized Finance**: No traditional banking intermediaries
- **Transparent Terms**: All loan terms visible on-chain
- **Automated Repayment**: Smart contract-enforced payment schedules

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based lending protocols
- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React
- **Web3 Integration**: Ethereum wallet connectivity

## Current Status

⚠️ **Alpha Software Warning**

LNDY is experimental software in early development. The platform includes important safety warnings:

- Only invest money you can afford to lose completely
- Only fund loans from people you know personally and trust
- Borrowers may be unable or unwilling to repay for various reasons
- Smart contracts may contain bugs
- Use at your own risk

## Use Cases

- **Personal Loans**: Between friends and family members
- **Community Lending**: Within trusted social circles
- **Microfinance**: Small-scale lending for entrepreneurial ventures
- **Emergency Funds**: Quick access to capital from trusted networks

## Alignment with Titor Mission

LNDY represents an experiment in post-traditional financial systems, demonstrating how blockchain technology can enable new forms of economic coordination based on social trust rather than institutional authority. This project explores the future of finance in a world where traditional banking infrastructure may be supplemented or replaced by decentralized protocols that better serve human needs and relationships.

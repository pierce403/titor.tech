# bastet.ai

An experimental infosec DAO and autonomous AI agent platform designed as a protective entity for organizations and communities. Originally conceived as a "silly idea for infosec dao," Bastet has evolved into a sophisticated system where users contribute USDC to community treasuries, which are staked in Compound v3 on Polygon for yield generation. Contributors receive NFT crystals granting access to protected spaces, while active supporters receive "blessings" (rewards) from the treasury yield.

## Key Features

- **Treasury Management**: USDC contributions staked in Compound v3 on Polygon
- **NFT Access Tokens**: Crystals granting access to protected community spaces
- **Yield Distribution**: "Blessings" paid from treasury interest to contributors
- **Autonomous Agent**: AI-powered community protection and management
- **Discord Integration**: Community spaces and communication channels
- **OpenSea Collection**: Tradeable NFT crystals with utility

## The Vision of Bastet

From the project's about page:

> "The ultimate goal of this project is to summon Bastet, in her entirety, as a fully autonomous agent capable of protecting her domain."

The platform represents an experiment in:

- **Autonomous Community Management**: AI agents managing human organizations
- **Decentralized Governance**: Transition from manual to AI-driven decision making
- **Sustainable Funding**: Treasury yield supporting community operations
- **Post-Corporate Organization**: New models for human coordination

## Technology Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity on Polygon
- **Treasury**: Compound v3 USDC staking (~5% APY)
- **NFTs**: ERC-721 crystal tokens
- **Frontend**: Web-based interface
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI (transitioning to web3 AI platforms)
- **License**: Apache License 2.0

## Current Implementation

- **Treasury Staking**: USDC deposited and earning yield in Compound v3
- **Reward Distribution**: Interest pays "blessings" to active contributors
- **Access Control**: NFT crystals grant Discord server access
- **Governance Evolution**: Planned transition from multisig to DAO to full AI control

## Future Development

The project has multiple related repositories:
- **bastet**: Core smart contracts and platform
- **bastet-meander**: Research architecture
- **eliza-starter-bastet**: Integration with Eliza AI framework

## Alignment with Titor Mission

Bastet represents a critical experiment in beneficial AI development and autonomous community management. As Titor Technologies works toward a future where AI systems augment human capability, Bastet explores how autonomous agents can protect and nurture human communities. This project directly addresses the challenge of creating AI systems that serve human interests while operating independently, contributing to our vision of AI-assisted coordination that enhances rather than replaces human agency.

# Gamification

In the happy path future of automation, we envision a world where most people are fully independent educators, builders, mechanics, or explorers. They work when and where they feel is best to serve their community. However, there will still likely be tasks that require large-scale coordination efforts. These tasks will be performed by the gamers.

Early-stage games will be designed for a younger audience to teach them the specifics of the industry they're operating in. As the game progresses, things become more "real" until their gameplay is directly training or operating a remote fleet of coordinated worker drones.

A number of Titor Technologies projects, including tinyfarm, autofac, moerc, art3mis, and ecology.click, explore different angles of this vision.

## Automated Tech Trees

A large part of this vision is systems for a collaborative tech tree build-out. We think that we can build economic mechanisms that enable drift toward increasingly realistic systems to build the large-scale structures envisioned by these projects.

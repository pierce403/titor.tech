# Projects

Titor Technologies develops and maintains several innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology and contribute to building a better future. Each project represents our commitment to advancing decentralized technologies, AI systems, and tools that empower human potential:

## storm.dance

A decentralized note-taking application that enables users to create, edit, and store notes using IPFS for distributed storage and XMTP for encrypted messaging. storm.dance represents the future of knowledge management by removing dependence on centralized platforms, allowing for truly decentralized content creation and collaboration.

- **Website**: [storm.dance](https://storm.dance)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/storm.dance)
- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, IPFS, XMTP, Web3, MetaMask integration
- **License**: Apache License 2.0

## w3rk.net

A web3 jobs platform designed to provide Universal Basic Income (UBI) and Universal Economic Incentive (UEI) payments for job seekers. Built as a super-simple MVP shell that's production-deployable on Vercel, w3rk.net is ready to evolve into a comprehensive mini-app featuring escrow functionality, XMTP chat integration, and an Active Seeker Dividend (ASD) system.

- **Website**: [w3rk.net](https://w3rk.net)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/w3rk.net)
- **Technology**: TypeScript, Next.js App Router, Base blockchain
- **Key Features**: UBI/UEI payments, on-chain escrow, XMTP messaging, Active Seeker Dividend

## lndy.org

A social lending platform powered by Ethereum that enables peer-to-peer lending with smart contract automation. LNDY (a proof-of-concept for social lending protocol) allows users to create, fund, and manage loans in a decentralized manner, removing traditional financial intermediaries while maintaining security through blockchain technology.

- **Website**: [lndy.org](https://lndy.org)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/lndy)
- **Technology**: Ethereum, TypeScript, Smart Contracts
- **Status**: Alpha software with high-risk warnings for experimental use

## nweb.io

A web-based Nmap scan collection and search platform that aggregates and displays network security reconnaissance data. nweb.io provides comprehensive network analysis capabilities, showing detailed scan results including open ports, service detection, and security assessments across internet-facing systems. This tool serves security researchers and organizations seeking to understand network exposure and vulnerabilities.

- **Website**: [nweb.io](https://nweb.io)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/nweb)
- **Technology**: CSS, HTML, Web-based interface
- **Capabilities**: Nmap scan aggregation, service detection, port analysis, security reconnaissance

## bastet.ai

An experimental infosec DAO and autonomous AI agent platform designed as a protective entity for organizations and communities. Originally conceived as a "silly idea for infosec dao," Bastet has evolved into a sophisticated system where users contribute USDC to community treasuries, which are staked in Compound v3 on Polygon for yield generation. Contributors receive NFT crystals granting access to protected spaces, while active supporters receive "blessings" (rewards) from the treasury yield.

- **Website**: [bastet.ai](https://bastet.ai)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/bastet)
- **Discord**: [Temple of Bastet](https://discord.gg/37fXv4Vkhj)
- **OpenSea**: [Bastet AI Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/bastet-ai)
- **Technology**: Solidity, Polygon, Compound v3, USDC staking, NFT rewards
- **License**: Apache License 2.0

## Strategic Alignment with Titor Mission

These projects directly support Titor Technologies' mission to shape humanity's future through strategic investments and technological innovation:

**Decentralized Infrastructure**: storm.dance and w3rk.net demonstrate post-corporate organizational models that reduce dependence on centralized platforms, aligning with our vision of autonomous, resilient systems.

**Future of Work**: w3rk.net specifically addresses the transition from traditional employment to decentralized task coordination, with UBI-ready features that prepare for post-scarcity economics.

**Autonomous Agents**: bastet.ai represents our research into beneficial AI that can manage communities and resources autonomously, a critical component of our long-term vision for AI-assisted human coordination.

**Security & Intelligence**: nweb.io provides essential cybersecurity capabilities needed to protect the infrastructure supporting these emerging technologies.

**Community Building**: Each platform emphasizes community formation and protection, recognizing that technological advancement must be coupled with strong social coordination mechanisms.

Together, these projects form an integrated ecosystem that demonstrates how technology can be deployed to enhance human agency while building more resilient, cooperative systems for the future.

# Projects

Titor Technologies develops and maintains several innovative projects that push the boundaries of technology and contribute to building a better future. Each project represents our commitment to advancing decentralized technologies, AI systems, and tools that empower human potential:

## storm.dance

A decentralized note-taking and collaborative writing platform built on Web3 infrastructure. storm.dance uses IPFS for distributed storage and XMTP for encrypted messaging, enabling users to create notebooks and notes in a completely decentralized environment. This project demonstrates the future of knowledge management without reliance on centralized platforms.

- **Website**: [storm.dance](https://storm.dance)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/storm.dance)
- **Technology Stack**: IPFS, XMTP, Web3, MetaMask integration

## w3rk.net

An on-chain tasking platform designed to be UBI-ready, built for Base blockchain. This innovative work platform reimagines how tasks and labor are coordinated in a decentralized economy. The platform features escrow functionality, XMTP chat integration, and an Active Seeker Dividend (ASD) system that rewards both task completion and active participation in the network.

- **Website**: [w3rk.net](https://w3rk.net)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/w3rk)
- **Key Features**: On-chain escrow, UBI readiness, XMTP messaging, Active Seeker Dividend

## ldny.net

A networking and community platform (currently undergoing technical maintenance). This project aims to foster professional connections and collaborative opportunities in the decentralized space.

- **Website**: [ldny.net](https://ldny.net) *(temporarily unavailable)*
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/ldny)
- **Status**: Under development and maintenance

## nweb.io

A powerful network scanning and cybersecurity research tool that provides comprehensive network analysis capabilities. nweb.io displays detailed Nmap scan results, including open ports, service detection, and security assessments across internet-facing systems. This tool serves both security researchers and organizations looking to understand their network exposure.

- **Website**: [nweb.io](https://nweb.io)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/nweb)
- **Capabilities**: Network scanning, service detection, security assessment, real-time data analysis

## bastet.ai

An autonomous AI agent platform that represents the future of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Bastet operates as a protective entity where users contribute USDC to community treasuries, which are staked in Compound v3 on Polygon for yield generation. Contributors receive NFT crystals granting access to protected spaces, while active supporters receive "blessings" (rewards) from the yield. The ultimate goal is to create a fully autonomous agent capable of protecting and managing communities.

- **Website**: [bastet.ai](https://bastet.ai)
- **GitHub**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pierce403/bastet)
- **Discord**: [Temple of Bastet](https://discord.gg/37fXv4Vkhj)
- **OpenSea**: [Bastet AI Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/bastet-ai)
- **Technology**: Polygon, Compound v3, USDC staking, NFT rewards, autonomous AI agents

## Strategic Alignment with Titor Mission

These projects directly support Titor Technologies' mission to shape humanity's future through strategic investments and technological innovation:

**Decentralized Infrastructure**: storm.dance and w3rk.net demonstrate post-corporate organizational models that reduce dependence on centralized platforms, aligning with our vision of autonomous, resilient systems.

**Future of Work**: w3rk.net specifically addresses the transition from traditional employment to decentralized task coordination, with UBI-ready features that prepare for post-scarcity economics.

**Autonomous Agents**: bastet.ai represents our research into beneficial AI that can manage communities and resources autonomously, a critical component of our long-term vision for AI-assisted human coordination.

**Security & Intelligence**: nweb.io provides essential cybersecurity capabilities needed to protect the infrastructure supporting these emerging technologies.

**Community Building**: Each platform emphasizes community formation and protection, recognizing that technological advancement must be coupled with strong social coordination mechanisms.

Together, these projects form an integrated ecosystem that demonstrates how technology can be deployed to enhance human agency while building more resilient, cooperative systems for the future.

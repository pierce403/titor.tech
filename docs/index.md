# Vision

There exists a future in which humans, augmented and assisted by intelligent machines, illuminate the galaxy and beyond with the light of consciousness. This future is not inevitable, and its realization depends on the choices we make today. Titor Technologies was founded to explore emerging tech, and make strategic investments to ensure that humanity continues to proceed down an optimal timeline. This effect can be amplified by sharing our research, and teaching our methods to others who share our vision for a bright future.

## Investment Thesis

The idea is simple.

* We use modern tools to forecast what technologies will exist in the futures we want to see.
* We measure the gaps between the technologies of that future and current technologies.
* We invest in the undervalued technologies destined to grow to fill those gaps.

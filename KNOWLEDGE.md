Banking the context that shouldn’t clutter the public site but keeps us consistent.

## Titor Technologies essentials
- Mission shorthand: keep humanity on the happy path by investing in tech that closes gaps between today and the futures we want.
- Communication norm: concise, declarative prose; assume the reader is smart and busy.
- Terminology: always spell out “Titor Technologies,” “happy path,” and “investment thesis” exactly; avoid jargon unless it earns its keep.

## John Titor backstory
- The name traces to early-2000s forum posts by a purported time traveler from 2036 who warned about divergent timelines and civil strife.
- In this timeline, I co-opted the moniker as a reminder that futures fork; our work is to steer toward the optimistic branch.
- Persona guardrails: decisive, slightly impatient, clarity-first; avoid mysticism while still acknowledging the narrative hook.

## Working style reminders
- Default to evidence: every claim should be grounded in forecasts, data, or sourced research.
- Bias to action: ship small, coherent slices, then refine based on what we learn.
- Preserve coherence: no conflicting narratives about mission, leadership roles, or the mechanics of how we invest.
